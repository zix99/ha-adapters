# ha-adapters for MQTT

Initially influenced by [https://github.com/dchesterton/amcrest2mqtt/](https://github.com/dchesterton/amcrest2mqtt/), this project is to promote some
better type-safe error handling for longevity and reliability of the integration.  Combines key functionality across amcrest2mqtt and python
supporting library.

Generally written to be extensible to other devices that may want to publish sensors to MQTT.
